    <h1>Flatbread</h1>
    <h2>What you will need</h2>
        <p>1 cup rye flour
            1 cup barley flour
            1 cup wholemeal flour
            1 cup whey, but yoghurt or beer will do nicely as well
            2 teaspoon salt
            Water as needed. The dough should be elastic, but not stick to the table.</p>
    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <p>Mix the different flours with salt, whey and water to form a springy dough. Let it rest for 30 minutes.

        Knead one portion of this basic dough well and add the flavours you like. See our suggestions below.
        
        Make 8 small flatbreads about 1 cm thick. Sprinkle with flour and let them rest for another 20 minutes. In the meantime you want to heat up a frying pan over a fire, on the barbecue or on the cooker. Bake/cook the flatbreads on a dry pan over medium heat (live coals) till golden brown.
